    <h1>🔴 TECH BREAKING NEWS: Google and OpenAI Announce New Limits on Free AI Generation</h1>
    <center><img src="nano.avif" alt="nano-banana-image"></center>
    
    <p>Silicon Valley, November 29, 2025:
    In a major move affecting millions of users worldwide, Google and OpenAI have quietly rolled out strict usage limits on their free AI tools, including image and video generation. The companies say the changes are necessary to manage increasing demand and maintain system stability.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Google Cuts Free AI Image Generation to Just 2 Per Day</h3>
    <p>Google has implemented a new limit that allows free users to generate only two AI images per day using its latest tools powered by the Nano Banana Pro model.

       Google says the decision was taken due to high server load, GPU shortages, and to ensure “fair use” for all users. Paid subscribers and Google Cloud customers will continue to receive higher or unlimited quotas.

        Industry experts suggest this may be part of Google’s long-term plan to push more users toward paid AI services.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>OpenAI Restricts Free AI Video Creation</h3>
    <p>OpenAI has followed a similar path. The company now allows free users to create only six AI-generated videos per day on platforms powered by its latest video models.

According to the company, video generation consumes significantly higher computational resources, and limiting free usage will help maintain quality and prevent misuse.

Analysts believe OpenAI is preparing for the release of its next-generation AI model, which requires massive compute power and infrastructure investment.</p>
